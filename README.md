## Overview

## My reasoning to create this project



## How I expected the project to go


## What went well



## What didn't go well
When creating my entities I realsied to start the idea off I was thinking about every little detail and should have thought about the idea being simple. What I mean by this is for each session there are alot of variables such as the differernt settings on a bow, the different arrow setups and different session environments ect. Thus I decide to narrow down my variables. Another problem arose when naming my columns. For example I wanted to date each session that was recorded but DATE is a reserved word in MySQL so I changed the column name to "dated" for now. In the future I will make the names of each column neater.
When trying to connect to the H2 database I could see that I had my SpringBoot application connecting with MySQL creating the table however I was unable to connect to the H2database through my browser. I was struggling to find the problem when I realised the java file in the entity package I named 'session.java'. "Session" is a reserved word also therefore I had to change my entity java file to "shoot.java".
